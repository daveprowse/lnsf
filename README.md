This is the repository for the live webinar: *Linux Networking & Security Fundamentals*.

You will find the lab guides for Day 1 and Day 2 within this repository as well as some other fun stuff. Enjoy!

**IMPORTANT!** Make sure that you have at least two Linux systems ready to go!

To follow along with me I recommend a Linux client and a Linux server. I'll be running the following virtual machines:

- Debian 12 client (with the GNOME desktop)
- Debian 12 server. (To install Debian as a server simply deselect all desktop environments during the task selection phase.)

> Note: You can find step-by-step instructions and videos about how to install Debian at my [website](https://prowse.tech/linux-installs/). General webinar setup suggestions can be found [here](https://prowse.tech/webinars/).

- Ubuntu 22.04 Server
- Centos 9 Stream (as a server, no GUI)
- OpenSUSE
- Fedora Workstation 39

I'll also have physical systems and cloud-based Linux systems at the ready.

Enjoy the course!
