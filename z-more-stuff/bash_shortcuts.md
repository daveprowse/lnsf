# Bash Shortcuts

Here's a Bash shortcut cheat sheet for you. These are based on a standard Linux installation using a Bash terminal. 🖥️

## Auto-Completion
`tab`

Use auto-completion! This shortcut will save you the most time! Use the `tab` key to automatically complete filenames, directory names, and commands. 

## Working with Processes

`Ctrl + z` - Stops a process (such as a ping or the "top" program)

`Ctrl + c` - Kills a process (Use only if `Ctrl + z` does not work)

`Ctrl + d` - logs out of a connection or terminal

## Working with the Screen

`Ctrl + l` - clears the display (but not the buffer)

`clear` - clears the display and the terminal buffer

`F11` - Full screen (desktop environments only)

## Working with Commands

`Ctrl + u` - clears the current command (also cuts and adds to clipboard)

`Ctrl + w` - undo the last word (also cuts and adds to clipboard)

`Ctrl + p` or `up arrow` - goes to the previous command in the bash history

`Ctrl + n` or `down arrow` - goes to the next command in the bash history

`Ctrl + r` - Brings up the "reverse-i-search". You can type the first letter of a command in history and run it. Exit this special prompt with `Ctrl + g` or `Ctrl + c`.

## Working with the Cursor

`Ctrl + a` - go to the beginning of the line (or the `home` key`)

`Ctrl + e` - go to the end of the line (or the `end` key)

`Alt + b` - go back one word

`Alt + f` - go forward one word

`Ctrl + b` - go back one character

`Ctrl + f` - go forward one character

## Working with Text

`Ctrl+w` - cut the word before the cursor, adding it to the clipboard.

`Ctrl+k` - cut the part of the line after the cursor

`Ctrl+u` - cut the part of the line before the cursor

`Ctrl+y` - paste the last thing you cut from the clipboard. 'y' here stands for "yank". (Also used in Vim)

`Alt+u` - convert every character from the cursor to the end of the current word to uppercase.

`Alt+l` - convert every character from the cursor to the end of the current word to lowercase.

`Alt+c` - convert the character under the cursor to uppercase.
